/* Native reimplementations of selected 6502 routines.
 *
 * Each function here REPLACES the transliterated version: its address is listed
 * in transpile.py's VALIDATE_FUNCS, so the transpiler emits the faithful
 * transliteration under a `__t6502` suffix and leaves the plain name to us.
 * All call sites invoke the plain name, so these are live in the real build.
 *
 * The contract is the OBSERVABLE MACHINE STATE at the call boundary — primarily
 * mem[] (zero-page + RAM). tools/validate_native.c proves each function here is
 * equivalent to its `__t6502` twin across a large random input corpus before it
 * ships. This is the regen-safe seam for the eventual Amiga reimplementation:
 * everything not listed in VALIDATE_FUNCS stays transliterated and regenerable.

/* divide_16x16 @ $9D6F — restoring 16-bit divide.
 *
 * Inputs : dividend $00B0(lo)/$00B1(hi), divisor $00AE(lo)/$00AF(hi),
 *          quotient accumulator $00B2 (its 8 bits are fully shifted out).
 * Outputs: remainder -> $00B0/$00B1, quotient -> $00B2,
 *          divisor left shifted by the normalization count -> $00AE/$00AF.
 * Domain : divisor in [0x0001, 0x7FFF] (the normalization shifts the divisor's
 *          top set bit to bit14; divisor 0 or >=0x8000 would not terminate —
 *          the original game never calls it outside this range).
 *
 * This mirrors the 6502 shift-subtract structure in clean C so the memory
 * effects are bit-identical to the transliteration; the 6502 register/flag
 * exit state is intentionally NOT reproduced because both call sites save Y
 * through $009F and overwrite A/flags immediately (verified — incidental/dead).

 * Effect : zeroes 44 terrain rows (base $1010, stride $60) across 42 columns
 *          starting at X (the X index runs as a 6502 byte, so it WRAPS at $FF —
 *          replicated here for bit-identity), then zeroes a scattered set of

 * Outputs: mem[$0094] = original X; the 42x44 terrain band and the listed object
 *          cells set to 0.
 * Contract: memory only.  Both call sites (flight loop $3EBF / $3EFA) reload X
 *          and A immediately after the call, so the 6502 exit register/flag state
 *          is dead.  We still reproduce it (A=0, Y=0, X=original, N/Z per LDX X)
